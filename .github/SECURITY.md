# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support security updates for the latest version released. Since this project is 
deployed at fiipregatit.ro, the latest GitHub release will match what's available online.

Regardless, if you think that the currently deployed version doesn't match GitHub, feel free 
to report that as well.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| > 2.2.1 | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.2.1 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any security related issues, please contact us security@civicnet.ro. 

We're a small, largely unfunded development team. What that means for you 
is that we're most likely not able to offer a bounty, and might not be 
as responsive as we'd like, depending on the amount of work we have on 
our plate.

However, we love it when people give us a helping hand, so we'd be more 
than likely to provide you among our peers, and via our available channels,
as well as thanking you on our website, if that is something you consider
helpful.
